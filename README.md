# NLP_PROJECT 

Description
The NLP Word Visualization project is a tool for visualizing textual data to gain insights into word usage, frequency, and relationships. Using techniques such as word clouds, word embeddings, and frequency distribution plots, this project helps analyze and understand textual datasets in a more interactive and informative way.This is one of the ML based projects based on the linear regression

Features
Word Cloud: Visualizes the most frequent words in a given text.
Frequency Distribution Plot: Plots the frequency of words in a dataset.
Word Embedding Visualization: Visualizes word embeddings (e.g., using PCA or t-SNE) to explore the semantic relationships between words.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifies and visualizes entities (people, places, organizations) in a text.
Collocations & Bigrams: Identifies and visualizes frequently occurring word pairs (bigrams).

Prerequisites,
To run this project, you need the following:
Python (3.x or higher)

Required Libraries:
nltk for text preprocessing and tokenization
 
matplotlib and seaborn for plotting
wordcloud for generating word clouds
gensim for word embeddings
spacy for named entity recognition and other NLP tasks
pandas for data handling
sklearn for dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
spacy for NER and syntactic parsing
transformers for using pre-trained transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT-2)
scikit-learn for machine learning models
pandas for data handling
numpy for numerical operations
