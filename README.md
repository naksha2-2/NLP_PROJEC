# NLP_PROJEC

Description
This project aims to provide solutions for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), text summarization, and more. Using state-of-the-art techniques and pre-trained models, this project demonstrates how NLP can be applied to real-world data, allowing machines to understand and manipulate human language.

Features
Text Classification: Categorize text into predefined categories.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a given text.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following:

Python (3.x or higher)
Required Libraries:
nltk for text preprocessing and tokenization
spacy for NER and syntactic parsing
transformers for using pre-trained transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT-2)
scikit-learn for machine learning models
pandas for data handling
numpy for numerical operations
To install these dependencies, you can use pip or conda. Here's how you can install the required libraries:
